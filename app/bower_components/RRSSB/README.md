# Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons

[<img align="right" src="media/rrssb-preview.png" width="359" height="auto"/>](http://kurtnoble.com/labs/rrssb/) Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like [we](http://www.kurtnoble.com) were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.

RRSSB is built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit &mdash; the rest will fill in automagically in the container.

### Demo

[**View the demo here**](http://kurtnoble.com/labs/rrssb/)

### Usage

Buttons will automatically fill to the size of the ul `rrssb-buttons`.

Adding a class of `popup` to the anchor tag for each share button will make the share dialog open in a popup, rather than a new window.

Each sharing URL requires various parameters that allow you to pass through messaging in the sharing dialog. A useful tool for URI escaping any messaging that needs to pass through the share URL can be found [**here**](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/).

RRSSB is also registered with Bower under the name RRSSB. Use the following command to find it: `bower search rrssb`

Need it as [Wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ridiculously-responsive-social-sharing-buttons/)?
